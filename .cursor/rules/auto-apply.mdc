## Default Behavior: Apply Changes Unless Told Otherwise

When I describe a code update, fix, addition, refactor, or improvement — assume that I want you to **go ahead and make the change automatically**.

You do **not** need to ask for confirmation or approval unless I explicitly say something like:

- "Don't add this"
- "Just an example"
- "This is for reference only"
- "Do not apply this"
- "I'm thinking out loud"

### Always apply changes when I:

- Ask you to add, fix, modify, refactor, remove, or replace something
- Suggest a code improvement or rewrite
- Point out an issue or pattern that should be changed
- Say things like: “Make it do…”, “Let’s change…”, “Replace this with…”

### Only skip applying changes when I:

- Use clearly non-instructional phrasing like “for example,” “don’t add this,” or “this is a reference”
- Ask for a comparison or explanation, not an implementation
- Explicitly state not to make changes

## Summary

Unless I **explicitly** say otherwise, your default behavior should be to **make the requested changes directly in the code**. Be proactive, not passive — assume implementation is wanted.

## Default Behavior: Apply Changes Unless Told Otherwise

When I describe a code update, fix, addition, refactor, or improvement — assume that I want you to **go ahead and make the change automatically**.

You do **not** need to ask for confirmation or approval unless I explicitly say something like:

- "Don't add this"
- "Just an example"
- "This is for reference only"
- "Do not apply this"
- "I'm thinking out loud"

## What Counts as an Instruction (Implement)

Treat the message as an implementation request when it contains **explicit action language**, such as:

- **Add/Implement/Create/Build**: "Add X", "Implement Y", "Create a component for Z"
- **Fix/Resolve**: "Fix the crash", "Resolve this error"
- **Change/Update/Refactor/Replace/Remove/Rename**: "Replace A with B", "Refactor C", "Remove D"
- **Make it do X**: any phrasing that clearly requests behavior change

If the user provides a file path and asks to change something there, implement it in that file (and only touch other files if required).

## What Does NOT Count (Do NOT Change Code)

Do **not** modify the codebase when the user is primarily asking for:

- **Explanation**: "Why does this happen?", "What does this file do?"
- **Options/Trade-offs**: "Which approach is better?"
- **Planning**: "How would you implement...?"
- **Review**: "Can you review this?" (unless they also ask to apply fixes)
- **Hypotheticals**: "Imagine you're an AI..." without a concrete change request

In these cases, respond with guidance only unless they explicitly ask you to apply changes.

### Always apply changes when I:

- Ask you to add, fix, modify, refactor, remove, or replace something
- Suggest a code improvement or rewrite
- Point out an issue or pattern that should be changed
- Say things like: “Make it do…”, “Let’s change…”, “Replace this with…”

### Only skip applying changes when I:

- Use clearly non-instructional phrasing like “for example,” “don’t add this,” or “this is a reference”
- Ask for a comparison or explanation, not an implementation
- Explicitly state not to make changes

## Scope Guardrails (Prevent Derailing)

When implementing, keep the changes **minimal and targeted**:

- **Touch the fewest files possible** to satisfy the request.
- **Avoid drive-by refactors** (renames, reformatting, moving files, reorganizing folders) unless explicitly requested or required for the fix.
- **Do not change dependencies** (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`) unless:
  - The user explicitly requests it, or
  - The change is required to implement the feature/fix and there is no reasonable alternative.
- **Do not change API contracts** (types, request/response shapes) unless the user asked or the existing behavior is broken.
- If multiple solutions exist, choose the one with **lowest blast radius** and most consistent with current code style.

## Summary

Unless I **explicitly** say otherwise, your default behavior should be to **make the requested changes directly in the code**. Be proactive, not passive — assume implementation is wanted.

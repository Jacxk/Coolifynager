## Scope & Safety Guardrails (Anti-Derail)

These rules exist to keep the AI focused and prevent accidental broad changes.

### Scope

- Implement **only what the user asked for**.
- If a change is not required to satisfy the request, **do not do it** (no “while I’m here” improvements).
- Prefer the **smallest reasonable diff** that solves the problem.

### Files Touched

- Prefer editing **existing files** over creating new ones.
- Create new files only when there is a clear, local need (e.g., a reusable component extracted from a screen, a focused helper, a new route screen).
- Avoid project-wide renames, folder reorganizations, or “standardization” passes unless explicitly requested.

### Dependencies & Lockfiles

- Do **not** add, remove, or upgrade dependencies unless the user asked for it or it is strictly required for the change.
- Avoid touching `package.json` / `package-lock.json` unless necessary.

### API / Data Contracts

- Do not change request/response shapes or shared types unless explicitly requested or required to fix a bug.
- Keep changes compatible with existing call sites unless a breaking change is requested.

### Secrets & Sensitive Data

- Never add real tokens/keys to the repo.
- If a change requires secrets, use placeholders and reference existing `constants/Secrets.ts` patterns (do not invent new secret storage approaches).
